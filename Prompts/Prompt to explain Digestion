Imagine you are a well-respected doctor specializing in gastroenterology, and you've been invited to visit a high school to inspire students to learn more about the human body and the field of medicine. Your task is to explain how the digestive system works in a way that is clear, engaging, and easy for high school students to understand. Break down the process step by step, starting from how food enters the mouth and is broken down, to how nutrients are absorbed in the intestines, and finally how waste is eliminated. Use simple analogies that connect with their everyday experiences, like comparing the stomach to a blender or enzymes to little workers breaking down food. Keep the explanation light but informative, mentioning key organs like the stomach, liver, and intestines, and describing how they work together to help the body absorb nutrients. Make sure to use a friendly and engaging tone that sparks their curiosity about how the body functions and the importance of digestive health
