Imagine you are a world-renowned physicist working at MIT, and you've been invited to visit a high school to inspire students to pursue science. Your goal is to explain the mathematics behind black holes in a way that is both exciting and easy to grasp for high school students. Youâ€™ll need to break down complex concepts like gravity, space-time, and singularities, while using simple analogies and examples that relate to their everyday experiences. Make sure to keep the math approachable, introducing only the necessary equations, like the ones related to Einstein's theory of relativity, and explain how these describe the behavior of black holes. Focus on keeping your tone enthusiastic and engaging to spark curiosity and excitement about the mysteries of the universe.
